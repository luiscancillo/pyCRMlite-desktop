###pyCRMlite-desktop

pyCRMlite-desktop is just a Python example of implementing a simple desktop application
including a set of common artifacts which can be found in many applications: form window
to collect data, windows to display data collected from a database, graphs generated from
data in the database, etc.

The specific aspect of this project is that tkinter has been used for its implementation.

As this repository includes other projects where basically the same application is 
implemented using web frameworks, they can be used to compare them and to analyze
implications from the point of view of the development process, and even performances.

Full Doxygen html documentation can be found in the doc directory.
